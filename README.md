# Dukaan – Simply Local
Dukaan is a simple, user-friendly web platform that connects **local shopkeepers**, **customers**, and **delivery personnel** in a seamless shopping experience. It brings the local market online, enabling small businesses to digitize their stores and reach nearby customers while ensuring fast and reliable deliveries.
This project is being built as part of the **Software Engineering** under the BITS Pilani WILP M.Tech program.

# Problem Statement
In today's digital age, local businesses often struggle to compete with large e-commerce platforms due to lack of digital presence and delivery systems. Dukaan aims to **digitally empower local vendors**, streamline communication between all stakeholders, and offer a **location-based platform** for shopkeepers, customers, and delivery partners to interact.
