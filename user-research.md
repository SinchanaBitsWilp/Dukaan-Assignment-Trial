# Dukaan – User Backgrounds

As part of our initial user research for the Dukaan project, we focused on understanding the three key user groups of our platform: Customers, Shopkeepers, and Delivery Personnel. Our goal was to learn about their everyday experiences, digital behavior, and common challenges, so we can build something that actually helps them.
